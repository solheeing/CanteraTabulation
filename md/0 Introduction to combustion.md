### Basic combustion terminology

- Stoichiometry(ÌôîÌïôÏñëÎ°†): the determination of the proportions in which elements or compounds react with one another.
- Equivalence ratio(Îì±Í∞ÄÎπÑ): Two ratios are said to be equivalent If they represent the same value when reduced to the simplest form.
- Laminar/Turbulent flames(Ï∏µÎ•ò/ÎÇúÎ•ò Ïú†Îèô): Laminar flames are smooth in appearance; they have what might be referred to as a smooth flow. Turbulent flames can be considered as¬†an aggregation of small laminar flames embedded in a turbulent flow field, distributed randomly, and have a one-dimensional structure, and the concept of small laminar flames can be used to set up a model of turbulent flame.
- Premixed/Diffusion flames: A premixed flame refers to a chemical reaction in which the fuel and the air are mixed before combustion, whereas, in a diffusion flame the fuel and air are separated and must come together before combustion. In order to burn, in both cases the fuel and air must come together.

Premixed flames


- Global/Detailed mechanism: Global mechanism is established to facilitate the mobilization of financial resources to implement the Convention and address desertification, land degradation and drought. Detailed reaction mechanisms refer to¬†a series of reactions that explain the experimental determination of the order of a reaction for each species involved, while also reproducing the stoichiometry of the reaction.
- Flame speed: the measured rate of expansion of the flame front in a combustion reaction. It is important to model combustion in CFD.
- Flame thickness: the width over which the entirety of the chemical to thermal energy conversion occurs.

### Consumption speed tabulation - 3 different flame speeds

1. Laminar unstretched flames(SL)
2. Consumption speed(SC)
3. Turbulent speed(ST)

The goal of the project is to compute the consumption speed depending on the stretch and heat loss.
